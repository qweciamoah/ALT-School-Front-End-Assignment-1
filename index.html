    <section id="reasons">
      <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
      <p>
        I chose ALTSchool because of its project-based learning approach and
        strong focus on real-world engineering skills. I believe in continuous
        learning and the power of technology to transform industriesâ€”including
        healthcare. As a Physician Assistant, I have seen firsthand how digital
        tools like telemedicine and electronic health records are changing
        patient care. I wanted to gain the tech skills needed to be part of this
        shift, and ALTSchool Africa provided the perfect platform. Beyond the
        learning, what really drew me in was the community which is a space
        filled with ambitious learners, mentors, and real-world projects that
        make education practical and engaging. It is not just about taking
        courses but it is about building skills that matter and connecting with
        people who share my vision. For me, this journey is about bridging
        healthcare and technology, future-proofing my career, and finding new
        ways to make a real impact. ALTSchool Africa is helping me do just that.
        The curriculum's emphasis on backend systems, database architecture, and
        cloud computing aligns perfectly with my career goals. I was
        particularly impressed by the success stories of ALTSchool alumni
        working at top tech companies.
